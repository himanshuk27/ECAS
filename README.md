# ECAS
Electives collection and Assignment System was developed for the KIIT School of Management (KOSM) so as to effectivly carry out the process of 
assigning its student their preffered course/subject. 
This process was done through pen and paper approach and then mannual allotment of the subjects. ECAS helped in enhancing and speeding up the process.
